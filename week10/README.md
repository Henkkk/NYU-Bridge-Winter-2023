## Agenda

This week we will continue using pointers, dynamic arrays, and the Vector data structure.  

You should plan the week as follows:

You may want to re-watch “Module 11 – Pointers and Dynamic Storage” video.
You may also want to re-read “Problem solving with C++” by Walter Savitch, chapters 8.3 and all of 9 (pages 489-534)
Attend the weekly webinar.
Solve homework assignment that will be posted on Friday


## Objective

Make sure that by the end of this week you:

Are able to use pointers to reference objects on the stack. </br>
Are able to use pointers to reference objects on the heap. </br>
Are able to allocate and deallocate memory on the heap. </br>
Understand how to use pointers to access arrays. </br>
Understand how pointer arithmetic works. </br>
Understand the potential pitfalls of using heap memory. </br>
Use vectors to solve a problem with a dynamic size. </br>
