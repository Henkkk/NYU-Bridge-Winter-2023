## Agenda

This week we will continue to talk about functions, and start talking about combinatorics. We will introduce basic counting techniques. We will see the sum rule and the product rule which are the basic rules in combinatorics. We will also introduce permutations and combinations.

You should plan the week as follows:

* [x] You may want to re-watch “Module 8 – Functions” video. And/or re-read pages 181-240, 251-292 in the “Problem Solving with C++” textbook (chapters 4 and 5)
* [x] Complete the reading assignment “Week 7: Counting Basics” in zyBooks
* [x] Complete the reading assignment “Week 7: Permutations and Combinations” in zyBooks
* [x] Complete the reading assignment “Week 7: Additional Topics” in zyBooks
* [x] Attend the weekly webinar.
* [x] Solve homework assignment that will be posted on Friday
