### Outputting Values of Type double

If you insert the following “magic formula” in your program, then all
numbers of type double (or any other type that allows for digits after
the decimal point) will be output in ordinary, everyday notation with two
digits after the decimal point:

cout.setf(ios::fixed);
cout.setf(ios::showpoint);
cout.precision(2);

You can use any other nonnegative whole number in place of the 2 to
specify a different number of digits after the decimal point. You can even
use a variable of type int in place of the 2.
